    <h2>Blastulation</h2>

    <p>
        The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the Fallopian tube. As it travels, it divides by mitosis several times
        to form a ball of cells called a morula . The cell divisions, which are called cleavage , increase the number of
        cells but not their overall size. More cell divisions occur, and soon a fluid-filled cavity forms inside the ball
        of cells. At this stage, the ball of cells is called a blastocyst . The process of blastocyst formation is shown
        in Figure below.

        <figcaption>Figure 1: The morula (1) continues to undergo cell divisions. As it does, cells start to migrate into separate layers, and a cavity starts to develop inside the ball of cells. When cells have migrated into distinct layers, the organism is called a blastocyst (2).

    <h2>Blastocyst</h2>

    <p>
        The cells of the blastocyst form an inner and an outer cell layer. This is apparent in Figure below. The inner layer of cells is called the embryoblast. This layer of cells will soon develop into an embryo. The outer layer of cells is called the trophoblast. This layer will develop into other structures, including the placenta, which you will read more
        about below. </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 2: shows the two layers of the ball shaped blastocyst. The outer layer is the trophoblast. Inside the blastocystcavity is the inner cell mass (embryoblast).

    <h2>Implantation</h2>

    <p>
        The blastocyst continues the trip down the Fallopian tube and reaches the uterus about four or five days after fertilization.
        When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells lining the uterus, the blastocyst embeds in the lining. The
        process of embedding is called implantation . It generally occurs about a week after fertilization. Once implantation
        occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo.
