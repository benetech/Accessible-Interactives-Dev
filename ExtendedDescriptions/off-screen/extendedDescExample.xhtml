<h1>Sample page of Complex Images with extended Descriptions</h1>
<p>
This page has three images each of which has an off-screen extended image description.  When Javascript is not present the extended descriptions should be automatically accessible to AT always (i.e. the user will have no choice but to hear the descriptions).  These extended image descriptions however will be coded to allow AT to navigate and escape the description to the next item on the page.  When Javascript is present the extended descriptions will be hidden to AT and a toggle button to show/hide the description will be available to AT to get more information on demand.
</p>
    
<h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p>This image has alt text and an extended description containing a paragraph and list, as well as a fig caption.</p>
    <figure>
        <img id="987123456-img-1" class="toggle-description" src="./Images/fig1.png" alt="A sagittal view of the human brain shows and identifies the different lobes and functional areas."/>
 
        <div id="987123456-img-1-ExtendedDesc" class="OffScreen extended-description" role="region" aria-labelledby="additional information">
            <p>The lobes and functional areas of the human brain are as follows, from the upper front of the brain clockwise over the top of the head:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <ul class="disc">
            <li>Frontal lobe; includes the Prefrontal cortex</li>
            <li>Precentral gyrus; includes the motor cortex</li>
            <li>Central sulcus</li>
            <li>Postcentral gyrus; includes the somatosensory cortex</li>
            <li>Parietal lobe</li>
            <li>Occipital lobe; includes the visual cortex</li>
            <li>Temporal lobe; includes the auditory cortex, Wernicke&apos;s area</li>
            <li>Lateral fissure</li>
            <li>Broca&apos;s area</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

        Moving on to our second example.
    </p>
<h2>Example 2</h2>
    <p>This Image is sufficiently described by the fig caption and surrounding text and as a result has no alt-text alt=quote quote, but does have an extended description.</p>
