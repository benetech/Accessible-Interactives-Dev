    <h1>Extended Descriptions Under each Image using ARIA described-by Aside</h1>

<p>In the following examples the aria-describedby is used to expose the extended image description which is in an aside.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Since aria-describedby will flatten all the extended image description text, we believe  the table within the extended image description will not be navigable using AT.</p>

    <h2>Example 7: Bar Chart</h2>

<p>Test 040<br/>
Support for describedby aside placed inside figcaption<br/>
The test passes if you are able to read/hear the following text when the focus is on the image:<br/>
"The chart shows the website hits for the first quarter of 2014. It shows that Site 1 has more visitors than
                    either of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant number
                    of visitors, while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month."<br/>
Note: there may be a lot more text read that is in a table.</p>

                <h3>Presentation</h3>
                <p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of
                    visitors per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns
                    lined up horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for
                    each website with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>
