            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The chart shows the website hits for the first quarter of 2014. It shows that Site 1 has more visitors than either
                of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant number of visitors,
                while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.</p>

            </table>
            <h3>Presentation</h3>
            <p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of visitors
                per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns lined up
                horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for each website
                with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>
        </div>
    </details>

    <p>In both these examples the HTML Details/Summary is used to expose the extended image descriptions. Aria-details also
        points to this details/summary which eventually will be picked up by assistive technologies and reading systems to
        make this a seamless experience.</p>

    <h2>Example 2: Detailed Description of Image</h2>

    <p>In this example, the head of the peacock is described using a paragraph of text that is on the web page.</p>

    <img src="../Images/peafowl-998cf337.jpg" alt="Male peacock head" aria-details="#image2-extended-desc" />
    <details class="extendedDesciption" id="image2-extended-desc">
        <summary>Expand / collapse description</summary>
        <div>
            <p>
                The male is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. The fan-shaped crest on the head
                is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with blush-green webbing. A white stripe above the
                eye and a crescent shaped white patch below the eye are formed by bare white skin. The sides of the head
                have iridescent greenish blue feathers. The back has scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings.
