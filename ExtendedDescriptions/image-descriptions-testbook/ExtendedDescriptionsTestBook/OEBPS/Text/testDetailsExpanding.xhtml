<h1>Details and Summary Expanding and Collapsing</h1>

<p>The expanding and collapsing nature of the HTML details element with the summary feature needs to be tested for accessibility. The example we have here is a very large chunk of text with HTML markup. When expanded, it would reflow into several pages. Some Reading Apps have a scroling view and others have a pagenated view. We want to make sure that this behaves correctly.</p>

<p>The text is a recipe  that is a real recipe you could try.</p>

<h2>Example 13: Details expanding and collapsing</h2>

<p>Test xyz<br/>
 Expanding details and ease of reading<br/>
 This test passes if you can expand the details and read the recipe and easily move back to where you left off. If the recipe expands to multiple pages, it is easy to navigate back. After the recipe you should see some End of chapter Header and text to ensure nothing was cut off.  Also if possible test both paginated and scrolling view.  Also test that you can read the end of chapter text when the details is expanded as well as after you collapse the details that the end of chapter text is also visible and accessible.  Please include notes on your experience.</p>


<details><summary>Goulash Soup</summary>
<h1>Soups and Stews</h1>

<p>In this chapter I will present the soups and stews that qualify to be called George&#39;s Goulash Soup.  While I have consulted many other recipies, there is no single other recipe that is the basis for my recipies, i.e. these are truly mine. I will also include tips and tricks about cuts of meat and thoughts about freezing.</p>


<h2>George&#39;s Goulash Soup</h2>

<p>While Gail and I traveled in Germany, Austria,  and  Switzerland in the Fall and Winter  of 1974, we often found Goulash Soup or sometimes called Humgarian Goulash Soup on the menus. We always had at least a cup and came to love all the variations. I have set out to make my own version of these wonderful dishes.</p>


<div class="listhead" >Ingredients</div>

</ul>
<aside role="doc-tip"> <p>Tip: I normally take a chuck (shoulder roast) or arm roast and remove all bone, fat and sinue to make the stue meat.</p></aside>
<div class="listhead" >Method</div>
<ol>
<li>In large pot, heat over high heat vegetable oil and crushed garlic.  When the garlic is fragrant, add onion or leek, followed by meat. Brown and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes.</li>

<li>Add beef stock, tomatoes, tomato sauce, paprika, pepper, chile powder, and simmer for at least 1 hour over low heat. the soup should just be on a low simmer.</li>

<li>Add carrots, and simmer for 30 minutes  on low. </li>
<li>Add potatoes and simmer for 30 minutes   (potatoes need a higher roll to cook).</li>
<li> Add peas and simmer for 30 minutes or until potatoes, carrots, and peas are soft and perfect!</li>
<li>Thicken with potato flakes (instant mashed potatoes) or other thickening agent, if desired.</li>
</ol>

<p>Serving SUGGESTIONS: Serve with fresh baked bread or rolls. Sour cream may be added at the table.</p>
<aside role="doc-tip"> <p>Deep Freezing: This soup freezes well. I will label a one quart ziplock bag with the name of the soup and date. I will remove any air in the bag and lay on a cookie sheet and place in the deep freezer. I then remove from cookie sheet and position in the deep freezer.</p></aside>
