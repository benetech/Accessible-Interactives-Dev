  <h1>Background</h1>
   <p>This Hybrid solution will incorporate techniques used from the MCAChicago.org Museum's website probided by Sina Bahram of Prime Access Consulting Inc.</p> 
   
    <p>This technique will show publishers how to include extende image descriptions that is designed inclusively for all.</p>
    
    <p>This is a made up example with free images and descriptions from BookShare.</p>
    <h2>Blastulation</h2>

    <figure>
    <img src="Blastulation.png" alt="Blastulation"/>
       <figcaption>Figure 1: The morula (1) continues to undergo cell divisions. As it does, cells start to migrate into separate layers, and a cavity starts to develop inside the ball of cells. When cells have migrated into distinct layers, the organism is called a blastocyst (2).</figcaption>

    <h2>Blastocyst</h2>

    <p>The cells of the blastocyst form an inner and an outer cell layer. This is apparent in Figure below.</p>

    <figure>
    <img src="Blastocyst.png" alt="Blastocyst" aria-details="#image2-extended-desc"/>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: shows the two layers of the ball shaped blastocyst. The outer layer is the trophoblast. Inside the blastocystcavity is the inner cell mass (embryoblast).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <details class="extendedDesciption">
        <summary>Expand to see details</summary>
        <p>The blastocyst consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast, a fluid-filled cavity, and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast. </p>

    <h2>Implantation</h2>

    <p>The blastocyst continues the trip down the Fallopian tube and reaches the uterus about four or five days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells lining the uterus, the blastocyst embeds in the lining. The process of embedding is called implantation . It generally occurs about a week after fertilization. Once implantation occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo.</p>
