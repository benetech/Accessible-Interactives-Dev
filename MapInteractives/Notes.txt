Basics:
Regions must be defined in SVG.
Data must be assignable to the regions defined by the user.
Name-value pair is the format of the data.

Low vision:
- Position the info box appropriately to the state
- Zoom of info box independent of zoom of map

Two philosophies for low-vision users:
- localization to the state
- localization to the screen focus

Data output:
- must stay within the screen
- info box must start at upper left of state's bounding box (convention is below and to the right of the cursor)--or at least be bound to it in such a way as to always stay on screen
- info box must be stylable:
  + font size
  + font face
  + background/foreground
  + zoomable separately from the map itself
- highlighting features for low vision
  + aria-select triggers it
  + customizing weight
  + customizing color of boundary
  + add icon in middle of the selected state
  + states around the selected state fade back in intensity
- zooming:
  + part of the widget?
  + rely on browser/system capabilities?

Zooming on a mobile:
- Allow user to orient map and info box relative to each other (above/below; side by side)
- Low-vision users: Very visible

Blind users:
- Serial navigation in first iteration (going through a table in whatever order in which it is sorted)
- Stretch goal: Navigable by keyboard input
- Aria-live reads information automatically and cannot be controlled to read line by line. Doug notes that we need to make it possible to "shift focus" in the aria-live info.

Goal: Not just to show information for one state, but also to show relationship to its neighbors.

Is there a way to let people apply their own supersets to the data? ("Midwest"; "Northeast"; "Old South"; "Solid South"; etc.)

Why not tables: Own limitations for how people can interact with them. Don't want to just sort--want people to be able to access their own way.
