<h1> Sample page with Math encoded as Images with MathML inside Details element</h1>
<h2> Image Math Description</h2>
<p>
This page uses &lt;img&gt; elements to encode math. It is preferable to use SVG rather than a raster format such as png so that the image scales nicely when the page is zoomed.  The image's alt text will contain "Equation: alt representation in details.  Below each image will appear a blank HTML Summary with an expandable Details element that will enclose the MathML.
