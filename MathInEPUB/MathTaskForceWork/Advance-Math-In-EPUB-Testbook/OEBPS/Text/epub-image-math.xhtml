        The objective of the test book is to identify the reading systems and assistive technology that support the technique explained as follows:
    </p>
     <p>
        This testing will help us identify the techniques for Math that are supported most widely in reading Apps and assistive technology combinations. With this information, we will develop best practices with publishers and also provide feedback to reading App developers for improving accessibility of their products. We will also provide this information to Assistive Technology developers.

    <p>
        1. If reading system supports Java Script then it places MathML in the DOM, which means that reading systems that use both Java script and MathML will provide access to MathML.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. If reading system does not support Java Script then the Image of MathML with alttext is shown. This acts as fall back mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid reading of duplicate expressions, The Java Script ensures that one of the above two mechanisms is hidden.
