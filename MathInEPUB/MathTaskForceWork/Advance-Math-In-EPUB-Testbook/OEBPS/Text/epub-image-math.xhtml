        The objective of the test book is to identify the reading systems and assistive technology that support the technique explained as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. If reading system supports Java Script then it places MathML in the DOM, which means that reading systems that use both Java script and MathML will provide access to MathML.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. If reading system does not support Java Script then the Image of MathML with alttext is shown. This acts as fall back mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid reading of duplicate expressions, The Java Script ensures that one of the above two mechanisms is hidden.
